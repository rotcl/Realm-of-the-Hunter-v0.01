### Game development

> Realm of the Hunter is my first try developing a game in GameMaker Studio 2.
> 
> In the first look, GML looks pretty friendly and easy to handle as a programming language, but the objects interface is terrible after all...
> 
> Compared to Unity or Unreal as games engines, GameMaker is miles away easy to use, anybody could start a game with some logic with just time and some research inside the GM Docs and the official forum.



> ROTH aka Realm of the Hunter is the result of a week trying to understand the mechanics of Realm of the Mad God.





> Realm of the Mad God is a massively multiplayer online shooter video game co-created by Wild Shadow Studios and Spry Fox in 2011, and later sold to Deca Games by Kabam in July 2016.
